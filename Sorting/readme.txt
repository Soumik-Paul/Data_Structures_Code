Quick sort has three main time complexities:

Best case: O(n log n) → Happens when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves each time.

Average case: O(n log n) → This is the usual performance when pivots are fairly balanced.

Worst case: O(n²) → Happens when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element, causing highly unbalanced partitions (e.g., already sorted array without randomizing).
